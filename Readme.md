# Node Sphero

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/reconbot/node-sphero.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## How to use

    npm install node-sphero

Connect your [Sphero](http://gosphero.com) to your laptop over bluetooth. At this time only OSX 10.8/OSX 10.9/Windows 7 has been tested. You will need at least

Add Sphero to your app:

```javascript
var roundRobot = require('node-sphero');
var sphero = new roundRobot.Sphero();

sphero.on('connected', function(ball) {
  ball.setRGBLED(0, 255, 0, false);
});

sphero.connect();
```

Run that and your sphero should turn #00FF00... green.

Check out the examples for more ideas.

## Installing

Node Sphero relies on node-serialport to communicate with the Sphero. Node-serialport is currently compatible with Linux, OSX 10.8 and up and Windows 7 and up running Node v0.8 and up. If you have issues installing Node Sphero and the errors messages say it cannot install node-serialport. Please checkout their [installation section](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport#to-install) and then [open an issue with](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport/issues?state=open) that project.


## In Progress

The rest of the sphero bluetooth api functionality.
